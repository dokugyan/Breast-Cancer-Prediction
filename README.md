Dataset Description: The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset from Kaggle contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image, such as radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, and more, which are used to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

Application of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm: The KNN algorithm is a simple, non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In this project, KNN is used to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on the similarity of the input data point to its 'k' nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Model Training and Evaluation: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train the KNN model and evaluate its performance. Various values of 'k' (the number of neighbors) are tested to find the optimal number that maximizes prediction accuracy. Model performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Feature Scaling: Since KNN relies on the distance between data points, feature scaling is crucial. Normalization or standardization of the dataset ensures that all features contribute equally to the distance computation, preventing features with larger numerical ranges from disproportionately influencing the model.
